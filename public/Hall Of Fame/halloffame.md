This updated CSS will create a layout very similar to the one in the image you provided. Here are the key changes:

The layout now uses a grid with 4 columns and auto-rows to allow for varying heights.
Specific positioning has been added for the first 9 frames to match the layout in the image.
The background color has been changed to a solid blue to match the image.
Frame sizes and content have been adjusted to fit the new layout.
The responsive design has been simplified to stack frames in two columns on smaller screens.

To implement this:

Replace the existing CSS in your halloffame.css file with the code provided in the artifact above.
Make sure your HTML structure matches the order of frames in the image.
You may need to adjust the content of some frames to fit the new layout, possibly shortening some descriptions.

This should give you a layout very close to the one in the image. The frames will fit snugly together with varying sizes, creating a visually appealing "wall of fame" effect.
Would you like me to explain any part of the CSS in more detail or suggest any further modifications to more closely match the image?
