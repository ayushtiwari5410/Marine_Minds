    <h2>Tsunami: The Science Behind the Waves</h2>
    <p>A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves caused by the displacement of water, typically due to underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. Unlike regular ocean waves, tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins and cause significant damage upon reaching coastal areas.</p>
    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tsunamis are generated by the sudden movement of the ocean floor, which displaces a large volume of water and creates waves that travel outward in all directions.</li>
      <li>Unlike wind-generated waves, which are typically less than 10 meters high, tsunamis can travel at speeds of up to 800 km/h in deep water and can reach heights of over 30 meters when they approach shallow coastal areas.</li>
      <li>The energy of a tsunami wave is spread over a large depth of the ocean, making it less noticeable in deep water but significantly more destructive when it reaches shallow waters near the coast.</li>
      <li>Tsunami waves can cause severe flooding, erosion, and damage to coastal infrastructure, making early detection and warning systems crucial for mitigating their impact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding tsunamis is vital for improving disaster preparedness and minimizing the damage caused by these powerful natural events.</p>

  procedure: `
    <h2>Experiment Procedure: Simulating Tsunami Waves</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare a long, shallow tray filled with water to represent the ocean.</li>
      <li>Create a small barrier at one end of the tray to represent the shoreline.</li>
      <li>Use a small piece of foam or a similar material to simulate an underwater earthquake by quickly displacing water at the opposite end of the tray.</li>
      <li>Observe the resulting waves as they travel towards the barrier. Note any changes in wave height and behavior as they approach the shore.</li>
      <li>Repeat the experiment with varying sizes of displacement to simulate different magnitudes of earthquakes and observe the impact on the wave formation and height.</li>
      <li>Record your observations and compare the effects of different displacements on the resulting tsunami waves.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This experiment helps illustrate how underwater disturbances create tsunamis and how these waves behave as they approach the shore.</p>

    <h2>Tsunami: Research and Analysis Assignment</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Explain the process of tsunami generation, including the types of events that can trigger tsunamis and how these events cause water displacement. Write a brief report (200-300 words) including examples of notable tsunamis in history.</li>
      <li>Investigate the effects of tsunamis on coastal communities and ecosystems. Describe the primary impacts and the challenges associated with tsunami recovery and preparedness.</li>
      <li>Design a hypothetical experiment to test the impact of different factors (e.g., water depth, wave speed) on tsunami behavior. Include:
        <ul>
          <li>A clear hypothesis</li>
          <li>Materials needed</li>
          <li>Step-by-step procedure</li>
