                        <p>We're thrilled to have you embark on this exciting journey into the heart of the ocean. Here,
                            you'll dive deep
                            into fascinating marine science topics, explore the forces that shape our seas, and
                            understand
                            the intricate
                            ecosystems hidden beneath the waves. From the surface to the ocean floor, this virtual lab
                            offers a unique,
                            interactive experience to quench your curiosity.</p>
                        <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> It’s simple! Just pick an experiment from the sidebar, and
                            you'll be guided
                            through each step. Each tab you see plays a key role in your learning experience. Let's walk
                            through them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Theory:</strong> Want to dive into the “why” behind the experiment? The Theory
                                tab
                                is your gateway
                                to understanding the science that underpins what you're about to explore.</li>
                            <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> Science thrives on precision. The Procedure tab will walk
                                you
                                through the exact
                                steps to carry out your experiment, just like in a real-life lab.</li>
                            <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> This is where the magic happens. The Simulation tab allows
                                you
                                to interact with
                                the experiment, observe results, and tweak parameters for different outcomes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> Ready to test your knowledge? The Assignment tab challenges
